Background

The current model for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is healthcare provider-centered rather than patient-centered. This approach may overlook individual patients’ unique needs, potentially impacting the effectiveness of T2DM management goals.

Objective

This study aimed to develop a patient-centered care model based on self-efficacy to enhance self-care and improve the quality of life for individuals with T2DM.

Methods

The study employed a cross-sectional design with a sample size of 250 respondents recruited through multistage random sampling, Jember regency, East Java, Indonesia. The study variables included exogenous factors (people with T2DM, situational treatment, family, and healthcare services) and endogenous factors (self-efficacy, self-care, and quality of life). Data were collected from August to December 2022 using a questionnaire and analyzed descriptively and inferentially using SEM-PLS.

Results

The developed model was a good fit with strong predictive relevance (SRMR = 0.065; Q2 = 0.049). All exogenous factors—people with T2DM, situational treatment, family, and healthcare services—significantly affected self-efficacy (42.2%, 37%, 8.1%, and 17.3%;

Conclusions

A patient-centered care model based on self-efficacy for managing T2DM can improve self-care behaviors and quality of life for individuals with T2DM. This model can be utilized by nurses in healthcare services to enhance the management of T2DM.





Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that requires proper medical management and ongoing self-care (American Diabetes Association,

Several studies have identified diabetes self-efficacy as a key factor influencing self-care behavior, which in turn affects the quality of life (Clara et al.,

In addition to internal factors, external factors such as situational care, family, and health service factors can also impact diabetes self-efficacy. Situational care factors, including the duration of diabetes and the presence of complications, may influence self-efficacy. Longer durations of diabetes are associated with lower self-efficacy (Shaban et al.,

Effective behavior management is essential for achieving treatment goals in people with T2DM (American Diabetes Association,

Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate effective preventive strategies into current diabetes prevention recommendations to enhance the efficacy of T2DM prevention and control through lifestyle interventions. Healthcare providers, especially nurses, should design lifestyle change interventions that focus on increasing self-efficacy to achieve optimal outcomes. This study aimed to develop a patient-centered care model based on self-efficacy to improve self-care behavior and quality of life for people with T2DM. Additionally, this study sought to examine the interactions among patient variables, situational treatment factors, and family factors on T2DM self-efficacy, self-care, and quality of life.



Conceptual Framework

The study variables consist of both endogenous and exogenous factors. The exogenous variables include four factors: characteristics of people with T2DM (X1), treatment situation (X2), family support (X3), and healthcare services (X4). The endogenous variables consist of self-efficacy (Y1), self-care (Y2), and quality of life (Y3).

The factors related to people with T2DM include knowledge (X1.1), coping (X1.2), motivation (X1.3), and diabetes distress (X1.4). The indicators for treatment situational factors are perceived health status (X2.1), duration of diabetes (X2.2), and perceived self-care ability (X2.3). The indicator for family factors is family support (X3.1), while the indicator for healthcare service factors is perceived healthcare services (X4.1).

Self-efficacy is measured by indicators such as general nutrition (Y1.1), specific nutrition (Y1.2), blood glucose control (Y1.3), physical activity and weight control (Y1.4), and medication adherence (Y1.5). Diabetes self-care behaviors include diet (Y2.1), physical activity (Y2.2), medication adherence (Y2.3), self-monitoring of blood glucose levels (Y2.4), and foot care (Y2.5). The indicators for diabetes quality of life consist of physical (Y3.1), psychological (Y3.2), and social domains (Y3.3) (

Data Collection

Data were collected door-to-door (offline) using questionnaires and interviews. Before data collection, researchers provided prospective respondents with an overview of the study, including its purpose, benefits, and procedures. Those who agreed to participate were asked to sign a consent form. Researchers conducted the interviews in the respondents’ homes, reading each questionnaire item aloud to reduce potential bias, particularly for those who could not read or were illiterate. The researchers recorded the respondents’ answers, and after the interview session, the respondents were asked to sign off on the interview results.



Data Analysis

Data were analyzed descriptively to describe the characteristics of the respondents, using frequency distribution, central tendency (mean), and dispersion (range, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval) with IBM SPSS Statistics V.26. Model development was conducted using path analysis via SEM-PLS with SMART-PLS V3 software. Measurement model analysis involved assessing 1) Convergent Validity Tests: Indicator loading >0.6 and average variance extracted (AVE) >0.5; 2) Internal Consistency Reliability Tests: Composite reliability >0.7 and Cronbach’s alpha >0.7; and 3) Discriminant Validity Tests: Fornell-Larcker Criterion and HTMT <0.9.

Structural model analysis involved evaluating: 1) Model Fit Index Evaluation: SRMR <0.08, NFI >0.90, d_ULS <0.877, and d_G< 0.342 (with 95% CI), Chi-square calculated >Chi-square table (df = 492) = 544.709, and RMS theta <0.102; 2) Coefficient of Determination (R²); 3) Effect Size (f²); and 4 Predictive Relevance (Q² >0).

Discussion

The model developed in this study was a fit model with good predictive relevance. The modeling results indicated that self-efficacy was an intervening variable connecting the exogenous variables—people with T2DM, treatment situational factors, family, and healthcare services—with the endogenous variables of diabetes self-care and quality of life. These exogenous variables significantly influenced diabetes self-care and quality of life through diabetes self-efficacy.

The research results revealed that all exogenous factors simultaneously impacted the quality of life of people with T2DM through self-efficacy and self-care behavior. Healthcare providers can enhance the quality of life by improving patients’ self-care behavior. This can be achieved by addressing the exogenous factors, including knowledge about diabetes, positive coping, motivation, and managing diabetes distress. Efforts to improve self-care behavior should involve enhancing patients’ perceived health status and self-care ability, considering the duration of diabetes, increasing perceived family support, and improving healthcare services. These factors collectively contribute to increased self-efficacy, which impacts self-care behavior and enhances the quality of life for people with T2DM.

The study found that the most significant factor influencing self-efficacy, and consequently self-care and quality of life, was the people with T2DM factor, including knowledge, coping, motivation, and diabetes distress. Specifically, the influence on self-efficacy was 42.2%, on diabetes self-care through diabetes self-efficacy was 26%, and on quality of life through diabetes self-efficacy and diabetes self-care was 7%. The study results were consistent with previous research, which indicated that diabetic patients with adequate diabetes knowledge have higher self-efficacy (Farley,

Treatment situational factors had the second strongest influence after the people with T2DM factor on quality of life through self-efficacy and self-care behavior. Indicators of treatment situational factors include perceived health status, perceived self-care ability, and diabetes duration. Specifically, the influence on self-efficacy was 37%, on diabetes self-care through diabetes self-efficacy was 22.8%, and on quality of life through diabetes self-efficacy and diabetes self-care was 6.2%. These findings align with previous studies that suggest diabetes duration affects self-efficacy. A longer duration of diabetes and related complications can decrease self-efficacy (Qin et al.,

Self-efficacy theory posits that previous experience (performance accomplishment) shapes self-efficacy and enables individuals to make appropriate behavior choices (Bandura,

Family factors had a weaker influence on quality of life through self-efficacy and self-care behavior, with perceived family support being the primary indicator. Specifically, the impact on self-efficacy was 8.1%, on diabetes self-care was 5%, and on quality of life was 1.3%. These results align with previous studies indicating that family support is crucial in diabetes management (American Diabetes Association,

Healthcare services factors were the third strongest influence on the quality of life for people with T2DM, with perceived health services support being the key indicator. Specifically, the influence on self-efficacy was 17.3%, on diabetes self-care was 10.6%, and on quality of life was 2.9%. The study supports previous research indicating that perceived health services support significantly influences diabetes self-efficacy. The quality of healthcare services during treatment affects diabetes self-efficacy. A well-functioning health service system can enhance self-efficacy (Farley,

The study results align with previous research indicating that self-care positively affects quality of life (Jafari et al.,



Strengths and Limitations of the Study

This study is the first in Indonesia to model diabetes self-care, quality of life, and self-efficacy and to explore the connection between self-efficacy and the influencing factors in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective was to clarify the components and relationships among these complex variables and their potential significance for clinical decision-making in T2DM patients. However, the study was limited to a community setting in the Jember Regency despite employing a multistage random selection method. It does not comprehensively analyze T2DM patients, especially concerning sociocultural variables.



Implications of the Study

The patient-centered care model focuses on enhancing patient self-efficacy. It was designed to address each patient’s unique needs and facilitate their individual capabilities and resources. The study results can serve as a framework for advancing nursing science, particularly in the care of individuals with T2DM. They also provide valuable information and references for patient empowerment in managing T2DM. Practically, this model can assist nurses in implementing patient empowerment programs to improve self-care behavior and the quality of life for people with T2DM.



Conclusion

A patient-centered care model that emphasizes enhancing self-efficacy by strengthening exogenous factors (including factors related to people with T2DM, treatment situations, family, and healthcare services) can improve self-care and quality of life for individuals with T2DM. Healthcare providers can enhance these exogenous factors through patient-centered education, training, and mentoring adjusted to socioeconomic status (such as age, education level, income, marital status, family type, health financing, and complications) to improve factors related to individuals with T2DM (such as knowledge, motivation, coping skills, and diabetes distress). Empowerment efforts should also address treatment situational factors, including perceived health status, self-care ability, and diabetes duration while optimizing family and healthcare provider support. Strengthening these exogenous factors can enhance diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and health-related quality of life by reducing the risk of complications. Future research could test this model further or explore additional factors influencing T2DM self-care and its impact on quality of life.
