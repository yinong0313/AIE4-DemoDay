The TMH cohort was more likely to be younger, female, White/Caucasian, using payment methods other than Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial insurers, residing in rural areas, and with higher household income compared to the non-TMH cohort.

This study examines the sociodemographic disparities in TMH utilization and its effects on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and medical expenditures in Mississippi. Utilizing a cohort of 6787 insured adult patients at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and its affiliated sites between January 2020 and June 2023, including 3065 who accessed TMH services, we observed sociodemographic disparities between TMH and non-TMH cohorts. The TMH cohort was more likely to be younger, female, White/Caucasian, using payment methods other than Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial insurers, residing in rural areas, and with higher household income compared to the non-TMH cohort.

As the virus spread rapidly across continents, its impact on various demographic groups, including children, became a subject of intense research. While children were initially thought to be less susceptible to severe COVID-19 illness compared to adults, concerns emerged regarding their vulnerability to other respiratory infections amidst the pandemic. Understanding the epidemiological trends of pediatric respiratory tract infections (RTIs) during the COVID-19 era is crucial for informing public health strategies and clinical management protocols. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and characteristics of pediatric RTIs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon. Methodology A retrospective, observational study was conducted by reviewing medical records of children admitted to three tertiary care hospitals in Lebanon: Sheikh Ragheb Harb University Hospital, Al Sahel General University Hospital, and Rafik Al-Hariri University Hospital. Data were collected from October 2018 to March 2021, encompassing both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 eras. A standardized data collection sheet was utilized to gather information on demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, duration of hospitalization, and antibiotic usage. Results Our analysis revealed significant shifts in the epidemiology of pediatric RTIs between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 eras. There was a marked decline in the proportion of school-age children hospitalized with RTIs during the pandemic period. However, the overall percentage of Lebanese hospitalized children across different age groups increased significantly during the COVID-19 era. Furthermore, the prevalence of specific RTIs, such as pharyngitis, increased from 1.1% in the pre-COVID-19\\\\u00a0to 5.5% during the COVID-19 period (p = 0.016), and the prevalence of bronchiolitis increased from 26.7% to 50.9% (p < 0.001) during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. This notable rise during the pandemic suggested potential changes in circulating pathogens or diagnostic practices. Importantly, the median length of hospital stays for pediatric RTIs decreased during the COVID-19 era compared to the pre-pandemic period, indicating possible improvements in clinical management or healthcare resource utilization. Analysis of antibiotic usage revealed ceftriaxone as the most frequently prescribed antibiotic in both periods, highlighting its continued relevance in the management of pediatric RTIs. Conclusions This study highlights significant epidemiological shifts in pediatric RTIs during the COVID-19 era in Lebanon. These findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and research to adapt public health interventions and clinical practices to evolving infectious disease dynamics. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the underlying factors driving these changes and optimize strategies for the prevention and management of pediatric RTIs in the context of the ongoing pandemic.\"}, {\"PMID\": \"38885115\", \"Title\": \"Initiating immunoglobulin replacement therapy helps reduce severe infections and shifts healthcare resource utilization to outpatient services among US patients with inborn errors of immunity.\", \"Abstract\": \"Patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are predisposed to severe recurrent/chronic infections, and often require hospitalization, resulting in substantial burden to patients/healthcare systems.

As the virus spread rapidly across continents, its impact on various demographic groups, including children, became a subject of intense research. While children were initially thought to be less susceptible to severe COVID-19 illness compared to adults, concerns emerged regarding their vulnerability to other respiratory infections amidst the pandemic. Understanding the epidemiological trends of pediatric respiratory tract infections (RTIs) during the COVID-19 era is crucial for informing public health strategies and clinical management protocols. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and characteristics of pediatric RTIs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon. Methodology A retrospective, observational study was conducted by reviewing medical records of children admitted to three tertiary care hospitals in Lebanon: Sheikh Ragheb Harb University Hospital, Al Sahel General University Hospital, and Rafik Al-Hariri University Hospital. Data were collected from October 2018 to March 2021, encompassing both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 eras. A standardized data collection sheet was utilized to gather information on demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, duration of hospitalization, and antibiotic usage. Results Our analysis revealed significant shifts in the epidemiology of pediatric RTIs between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 eras. There was a marked decline in the proportion of school-age children hospitalized with RTIs during the pandemic period. However, the overall percentage of Lebanese hospitalized children across different age groups increased significantly during the COVID-19 era. Furthermore, the prevalence of specific RTIs, such as pharyngitis, increased from 1.1% in the pre-COVID-19 to 5.5% during the COVID-19 period (p = 0.016), and the prevalence of bronchiolitis increased from 26.7% to 50.9% (p < 0.001) during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. This notable rise during the pandemic suggested potential changes in circulating pathogens or diagnostic practices. Importantly, the median length of hospital stays for pediatric RTIs decreased during the COVID-19 era compared to the pre-pandemic period, indicating possible improvements in clinical management or healthcare resource utilization. Analysis of antibiotic usage revealed ceftriaxone as the most frequently prescribed antibiotic in both periods, highlighting its continued relevance in the management of pediatric RTIs. Conclusions This study highlights significant epidemiological shifts in pediatric RTIs during the COVID-19 era in Lebanon. These findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and research to adapt public health interventions and clinical practices to evolving infectious disease dynamics. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the underlying factors driving these changes and optimize strategies for the prevention and management of pediatric RTIs in the context of the ongoing pandemic.\"},{\"PMID\":\"38885115\",\"Title\":\"Initiating immunoglobulin replacement therapy helps reduce severe infections and shifts healthcare resource utilization to outpatient services among US patients with inborn errors of immunity.\",\"Abstract\":\"Patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are predisposed to severe recurrent/chronic infections, and often require hospitalization, resulting in substantial burden to patients/healthcare systems.

Additionally, there is potential for missing data since patients may seek care at multiple institutions. This limitation was mitigated by limiting the study sample to patients who had evidence of regular care visits at UMMC and had evidence of insurance coverage for at least one visit. However, as the study sample consisted of insured patients who regularly seek healthcare from UMMC, it may not represent the entire population of Mississippi, such as those without any healthcare access, thereby limiting generalizability to uninsured populations.

To identify patients with sickle cell crisis and COVID-19, we opted for ICD-10 codes rather than clinical measures. This might have resulted in diagnosis misclassification.
